## Chapter 2

1) Write a loop that makes seven calls to console.log to output the following triangle:

    #
    ##
    ###
    ####
    #####
    ######
    #######
    
#### Solution

    for(i = '#'; i.length <= 7; i += '#'){
        console.log(i);
    }
    
2) Write a program that uses console.log to print all the numbers from 1 to 100, with two exceptions. For numbers divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for numbers divisible by 5 (and not 3), print "Buzz" instead.

When you have that working, modify your program to print "FizzBuzz" for numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5 (and still print "Fizz" or "Buzz" for numbers divisible by only one of those).

#### Solution

    for(i=1; i<=100; i++){
      if((i%3 === 0) && (i%5 !==0)){
        console.log('Fizz');
      }else if((i%5 === 0) && (i%3 !== 0)){
          console.log('Buzz');
      }else if((i%3 === 0) && (i%5 === 0)){
        console.log('FizzBuzz');
      } else{
        console.log(i);
      }
    }
    
3) Write a program that creates a string that represents an 8Ã—8 grid, using newline characters to separate lines. At each position of the grid there is either a space or a "#" character. The characters should form a chessboard.

    for(i=''; i<8; i++){
      if(i%2 === 0){
        console.log(` # # # #`);
      }else{
        console.log(`# # # #`);
      }
    }
